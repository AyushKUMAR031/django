few mini-projects you could try next (each will stretch your skills a bit more):

* **Todo App** → add, mark complete, delete tasks (focus on CRUD).
* **Blog App** → posts, categories, comments (learn relationships).
* **User Auth** → sign up, login, logout, profile (explore Django’s built-in `auth`).
* **Simple API** → build a JSON API with Django REST Framework (if you want to step into backend-for-frontend).
* **Styling** → add Bootstrap/Tailwind to make your project look more polished.
