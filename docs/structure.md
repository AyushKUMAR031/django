# Django Project Structure

This document explains the structure of this Django project. Understanding this structure is key to developing and maintaining a Django application effectively.

## Root Directory

This is the main container for your project.

- `manage.py`: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways. You'll use it to run the development server, create new apps, run database migrations, and more. You should never edit this file.

- `requirements.txt`: This file lists all the Python packages that your project depends on (like Django itself). This allows other developers to easily install the same packages in their own environments.

- `.gitignore`: This file tells Git (a version control system) which files and directories to ignore. This is useful for excluding files that are generated automatically or contain sensitive information.

- `project/`: This is the main project package for your project. It contains the configuration for your entire project.
    - `__init__.py`: An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package.
    - `settings.py`: Contains the settings and configuration for your Django project. This is where you'll configure your database, installed apps, static files, and more.
    - `urls.py`: The URL declarations for your project; a "table of contents" of your site.
    - `wsgi.py`: An entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project.
    - `asgi.py`: An entry-point for ASGI-compatible web servers to serve your project.

- `apps/`: This directory contains all of your project's applications. Keeping them in a dedicated directory helps to keep the project organized.
    - `__init__.py`: An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package.
    - `hello_world/`: This is a Django "app". An app is a self-contained module that performs a specific function. For example, you might have an app for a blog, another for user authentication, and so on.
        - `__init__.py`: An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package.
        - `admin.py`: This is where you register your models to be managed by Django's built-in admin interface.
        - `apps.py`: A configuration file for the app itself.
        - `models.py`: This is where you define your application's data models. Each model corresponds to a database table.
        - `tests.py`: This file is for writing tests for your application.
        - `views.py`: This is where you define the logic that handles requests and returns responses. Views are Python functions or classes that take a web request and return a web response.
        - `urls.py`: This file contains the URL declarations for the `hello_world` app.
        - `migrations/`: This directory contains database migration files. Migrations are Django's way of propagating changes you make to your models (adding a field, deleting a model, etc.) into your database schema.

- `.venv/` or `activate/`: These directories contain the Python virtual environment for this project. A virtual environment is an isolated Python environment that allows you to manage dependencies for different projects separately. You should not modify the contents of this directory directly.
